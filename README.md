# Aimbot Gun (Improved)
## Based on [Aimbot Gun](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129637512) workshop by uacnix

>Always disable various `Ricochet` options on other addons, **Especially ArcCW**.
>The `Ricochet` option in other addons **WILL** cause lua infinity loop, the stack overflow, and the game crashes.

So, here it is- the Aimbot Gun. Kill HUNDREDS of people with a single click!
Primary: Shoot heads
AFAIK it also locks onto other players, so I hope that there wont be silly admins giving it to players :D

As You know, I'm still new to LUA and although I'm testing the addons on two machines, there still might be some idiotic and hilarious errors I have overlooked.

And don't overuse this on servers :D

P.S:\
Yes, it might have problem with directly hitting small stuff, as far as I remember, it targets the eyes, so trying to hit seagull from 10KM will probably fail

## VAC STATUS
Running lua scripts is ALLOWED BY VAC

#### VAC CHECKS ONLY:
* 3rd Party programs messing up with the game (like changing values with Cheat Engine or some .EXE aimbots)
* Additional DLLs loaded to the game
* Any other "Physical interaction with the game files" such as changing textures to transparent and ♥♥♥♥.

For example, you can get b& for playing on a cracked/hacked lobby in COD:MW2, but you shouldnt get b& for e.g Loading a multifire macro on your mouse (if you happen to have the one that can save stuff onboard)

tl;dr its completely safe - you can get permab& on ONE SERVER BY ADMIN (Who was dumb enough to enable it for everyone), but YOU WILL NOT be banned by VAC.
